# Contributing to GHG Monitor

Thank you for your interest in contributing to GHG Monitor! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## ü§ù Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct:

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Focus on constructive feedback
- Help others learn and grow
- Prioritize the project's scientific accuracy and user needs

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Git
- Basic understanding of TypeScript, React, and Node.js
- Familiarity with greenhouse gas measurement concepts (helpful but not required)

### Development Setup
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ghg-monitor.git`
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend && npm install
   cd ../frontend && npm install
   ```
4. Start development servers:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd backend && npm run dev
   
   # Terminal 2 - Frontend  
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```

## üîß Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- **TypeScript**: Use strict mode, provide proper types
- **React**: Use functional components with hooks
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names, follow camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components
- **Comments**: Document complex algorithms, especially scientific calculations
- **Formatting**: Use ESLint and Prettier configurations

### Commit Messages
Follow conventional commits format:
```
type(scope): description

feat(analysis): add cumulative flux calculation
fix(dashboard): resolve chamber count display issue
docs(api): update endpoint documentation
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

### Branch Naming
- Feature branches: `feature/description-of-feature`
- Bug fixes: `fix/description-of-fix`
- Documentation: `docs/description-of-change`

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend && npm test

# Frontend tests
cd frontend && npm test

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```

### Writing Tests
- Write unit tests for utility functions (especially flux calculations)
- Write integration tests for API endpoints
- Write component tests for React components
- Include edge cases and error scenarios

### Test Requirements
- All new features must include tests
- Bug fixes should include regression tests
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Scientific calculations must have validation tests

## üìä Scientific Accuracy

### Flux Calculations
- Reference scientific literature for formulas
- Include units in variable names and comments
- Validate against known test cases
- Document assumptions and limitations

### Quality Control
- Maintain configurable thresholds
- Document quality control criteria
- Test with various data quality scenarios
- Consider edge cases in field measurements

## üé® UI/UX Guidelines

### Design Principles
- **Clarity**: Scientific data should be easy to read and interpret
- **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG guidelines
- **Responsiveness**: Support desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Performance**: Optimize for large datasets

### Component Structure
- Use atomic design principles
- Create reusable components
- Implement proper loading states
- Handle error states gracefully

## üìù Documentation

### Code Documentation
- Document all public APIs
- Include examples for complex functions
- Explain scientific concepts for non-experts
- Update documentation with code changes

### API Documentation
- Document all endpoints in `API.md`
- Include request/response examples
- Specify error codes and messages
- Update OpenAPI specification
